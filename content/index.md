Hiiii there 👋

my name is Michal Miškolci, I'm a master's student of [Cybernetics, Control and Measurements 🤖](https://www.vut.cz/en/students/programmes/programme/9479) and [Information science student 📚](https://kisk-phil-muni-cz.translate.goog/uchazeci/magisterske-studium?_x_tr_sl=cs&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) in Brno. You can find my contacts [here 🖐](https://www.linkmory.me/id/w6tlrc5iv52ynht)

I have a huuuge passion in creating 🎨, improvising ✨, crafting 🛠️, art making 🖼️ and learning 🧠. I play piano 🎹 and ukulele 🎸, love dancing 💃, painting 🎨, drawing ✏️ ...

I also privately teach Math ♾️, Physics 🧲, Ukulele 🎸, and I'm opened to teach everything I have ever learned 🍎.

I currently work on these projects:

- [**PianoArt**](https://pianoart.onrender.com/) - Software that transforms piano performance into real-time visual art, creating immersive audiovisual experiences that respond dynamically to every note and melody
