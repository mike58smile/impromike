Hiiii there 👋

I'm a master's student of [Cybernetics, Control and Measurements 🤖](https://www.vut.cz/en/students/programmes/programme/9479) and [Information science student 📚](https://kisk-phil-muni-cz.translate.goog/uchazeci/magisterske-studium?_x_tr_sl=cs&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US) in Brno.

I have a huuuge passion in creating, improvising, crafting, art making and learning.
I play piano and ukulele, love dancing, painting, drawing...
I also privately teach Math, Physics, Ukulele, and I'm opened to teach everything I have ever learned.
